# Care-Connect: 동서양 의료 협력을 위한 소통 플랫폼

## 🎯 프로젝트 목표

본 프로젝트는 전통 중의학을 배우는 의료원과 현대 간호학을 배우는 의료인 간의 간극을 줄이는 것을 목표로 합니다. 서로 다른 의료 체계에서 비롯되는 문제점들을 명확히 인지하고 이해할 수 있는 정보 제공 사이트를 구축합니다.

### 💡 주요 고려사항 및 다룰 내용

- **의료 단어 차이**: 동일한 증상이나 질병에 대한 용어 차이 정리 (예: '기(氣)'와 에너지 대사)
- **의료 방법 차이**: 진단 및 치료 접근 방식의 차이 비교 (예: 맥진/설진 vs. 혈액검사/영상진단)
- **의료 시스템 차이**: 각 의료 체계의 구조 및 프로세스 차이 설명
- **의료 환경 차이**: 임상 환경 및 환자-의료인 관계의 문화적 차이

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
